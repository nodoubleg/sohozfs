<title>Storage maintenance</title>
<sect1 xml:id="maintenance-1"><title>Aspects of maintenance</title>
<para>
	Storage maintenance, especially DIY one, is a very wide subject. It is both technical and non-technical. In this chapter I will try to cover as much technical side as possible and as much non-technical as is sane. Surely, real non-technical side warrants a separate book on its own.
</para>
<para>
	Typical maintenance tasks start with monitoring the storage. You need to cover hardware health, software updates for your distribution, security issues, atypical access logs (intrusion detection? access privileges breach?). Many of those are outside the scope of the book.
</para>
<para>
	Monitoring is already covered in the chapter <xref linkend="monitoring" />.
